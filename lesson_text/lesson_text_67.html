<b>Indirect Statements in English.</b> Direct statements are those which
the speaker or writer makes himself or which are quoted in his exact
language. Indirect statements are those reported in a different form of
words from that used by the speaker or writer. Compare the following
direct and indirect statements:</p>

<p>Comparing these Latin indirect statements with the English in the
preceding section, we observe three marked differences:</p>

<p class = "note">
<i>a.</i> There is no conjunction corresponding to <i>that</i>.</p>

<p class = "note">
<i>b.</i> The verb is in the infinitive and its subject is in the
accusative.</p>

<p class = "note">
<i>c.</i> The tenses of the infinitive are not changed after a past
tense of the principal verb.</p>

<p class = "section">

<span class = "smallcaps">Rule.</span> <b>Indirect Statements.</b>
<i>When a direct statement becomes indirect, the principal verb is
changed to the infinitive and its subject nominative becomes subject
accusative of the infinitive.</i></p>

<p class = "section">


<b>Tenses of the Infinitive.</b> When the sentences in §&nbsp;415 were changed from the direct to the indirect
form of statement, <b>sunt</b> became <b>esse</b>, <b>erant</b> became
<b>fuisse</b>, and <b>erunt</b> became <b>futūrōs esse</b>.</p>

<p class = "section">

<span class = "smallcaps">Rule.</span> <b>Infinitive Tenses in Indirect
Statements.</b> <i>A present indicative of a direct statement becomes
present infinitive of the indirect, a past indicative becomes perfect
infinitive, and a future indicative becomes future infinitive.</i></p>

<p class = "note">
<span class = "smallcaps">Note.</span> When translating into Latin an
English indirect statement, first decide what tense of the indicative
would have been used in the direct form. That will show you what tense
of the infinitive to use in the indirect.</p>
