<b>The Ablative Relation.</b> The ablative case is used to express the
relations conveyed in English by the prepositions <i>from</i>,
<i>with</i>, <i>by</i>, <i>at</i>, <i>in</i>. It denotes</p>

<p>1. That from which something is separated, from which it starts, or
of which it is deprived&mdash;generally translated by <i>from</i>.</p>

<p>2. That with which something is associated or by means of which it is
done&mdash;translated by <i>with</i> or <i>by</i>.</p>

<p>3. The place where or the time when something
happens&mdash;translated by <i>in</i> or <i>at</i>.</p>



<p class = "section">

<b>Prepositions.</b> While, as stated above (§&nbsp;41), many relations expressed in English by
prepositions are in Latin expressed by case forms, still prepositions
are of frequent occurrence, but only with the accusative or
ablative.</p>

Prepositions denoting the ablative relations <i>from, with, in, on</i>,
are naturally followed by the ablative case. Among these are</p>

<b>Adjectives.</b> Examine the sentence</p>

<p class = "center">
<b>Puella parva bonam deam amat</b>, <i>the little girl loves the good
goddess</i></p>

<p>In this sentence <b>parva</b> (<i>little</i>) and <b>bonam</b>
(<i>good</i>) are not nouns, but are descriptive words expressing
quality. Such words are called <i>adjectives</i>,<span class =
"tag">2</span> and they are said to belong to the noun which they
describe.</p>



<p>You can tell by its ending to which noun an adjective belongs. The
ending of <b>parva</b> shows that it belongs to <b>puella</b>, and the
ending of <b>bonam</b> that it belongs to <b>deam</b>. Words that belong
together are said to agree, and the belonging-together is called
<i>agreement</i>. Observe that <i>the adjective and its noun agree in
number and case</i>.</p>

<p>In the first sentence the adjective <b>parva</b> is separated from
its noun by the verb and stands in the predicate. It is therefore called
a <i>predicate adjective</i>. In the second sentence the adjectives
<b>parva</b> and

<b>bonam</b> are closely attached to the nouns <b>puella</b> and
<b>deam</b> respectively, and are called <i>attributive
adjectives.</i></p>

In the preceding lessons we have now gone over all the cases, singular
and plural, of nouns whose nominative singular ends in <b>-a</b>. All
Latin nouns whose nominative singular ends in <b>-a</b> belong to the
First Declension. It is also called the <i>Ā</i>-Declension because of
the prominent part which the vowel <b>a</b> plays in the formation of
the cases. We have also learned what relations are expressed by each
case. These results are summarized in the following table:</p>

<b>The Base.</b> That part of a word which remains unchanged in
inflection and to which the terminations are added is called the
<b>base</b>.</p>

<p>
Thus, in the declension above, <b>domin-</b> is the base and <b>-a</b>
is the termination of the nominative singular.</p>

<p class = "section">


Write the declension of the following nouns, separating the base from
the termination by a hyphen. Also give them orally.</p>

<b>Gender.</b> In English, names of living beings are either masculine
or feminine, and names of things without life are neuter. This is called
<b>natural gender</b>. Yet in English there are some names of things to
which we refer as if they were feminine; as, “Have you seen my yacht?
<i>She</i> is a beauty.” And there are some names of living beings to
which we refer as if they were neuter; as, “Is the baby here? No, the
nurse has taken <i>it</i> home.” Some words, then, have a gender quite
apart from sex or real gender, and this is called <b>grammatical
gender</b>.</p>

<p>Latin, like English, has three genders. Names of males are usually
masculine and of females feminine, but <i>names of things have
grammatical gender and may be either masculine, feminine, or neuter</i>.
Thus we have in Latin the three words, <b>lapis</b>, <i>a stone</i>;
<b>rūpēs</b>, <i>a cliff</i>; and <b>saxum</b>, <i>a rock</i>.
<b>Lapis</b> is <i>masculine</i>, <b>rūpēs</b> <i>feminine</i>, and
<b>saxum</b> <i>neuter</i>. The gender can usually be determined by the
ending of the word, and <i>must always be learned</i>, for without
knowing the gender it is impossible to write correct Latin.</p>

<p class = "section">

<b>Gender of First-Declension Nouns.</b> Nouns of the first declension
are feminine unless they denote males. Thus <b>silva</b> is feminine,
but <b>nauta</b>, <i>sailor</i>, and <b>agricola</b>, <i>farmer</i>, are
masculine.</p>
