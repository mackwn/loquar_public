<h3>LATIN FOR BEGINNERS</h3>


<h4>TO THE STUDENT&mdash;BY WAY OF INTRODUCTION</h4>

<p><b>What is Latin?</b>
If you will look at the map of Italy on the opposite page, you will find
near the middle of the peninsula and facing the west coast a district
called Latium,<span class = "tag">1</span> and Rome its capital. The
Latin language, meaning the language of Latium, was spoken by the
ancient Romans and other inhabitants of Latium, and Latin was the name
applied to it after the armies of Rome had carried the knowledge of her
language far beyond its original boundaries. As the English of to-day is
not quite the same as that spoken two or three hundred years ago, so
Latin was not always the same at all times, but changed more or less in
the course of centuries. The sort of Latin you are going to learn was in
use about two thousand years ago. And that period has been selected
because the language was then at its best and the greatest works of
Roman literature were being produced. This period, because of its
supreme excellence, is called the Golden Age of Roman letters.</p>

<div class = "footnote">
1. Pronounce <i>Lā´shĭ-ŭm</i>.</div>

<p><b>The Spread of Latin.</b>
For some centuries after Rome was founded, the Romans were a feeble and
insignificant people, their territory was limited to Latium, and their
existence constantly threatened by warlike neighbors. But after the
third century before Christ, Rome’s power grew rapidly. She conquered
all Italy, then reached out for the lands across the sea and beyond the
Alps, and finally ruled over the whole ancient world. The empire thus
established lasted for more than four

hundred years. The importance of Latin increased with the growth of
Roman power, and what had been a dialect spoken by a single tribe became
the universal language. Gradually the language changed somewhat,
developing differently in different countries. In Italy it has become
Italian, in Spain Spanish, and in France French. All these nations,
therefore, are speaking a modernized form of Latin.</p>

<p><b>The Romans and the Greeks.</b>
In their career of conquest the Romans came into conflict with the
Greeks. The Greeks were inferior to the Romans in military power, but
far superior to them in culture. They excelled in art, literature,
music, science, and philosophy. Of all these pursuits the Romans were
ignorant until contact with Greece revealed to them the value of
education and filled them with the thirst for knowledge. And so it came
about that while Rome conquered Greece by force of arms, Greece
conquered Rome by force of her intellectual superiority and became her
schoolmaster. It was soon the established custom for young Romans to go
to Athens and to other centers of Greek learning to finish their
training, and the knowledge of the Greek language among the educated
classes became universal. At the same time many cultured
Greeks&mdash;poets, artists, orators, and philosophers&mdash;flocked to
Rome, opened schools, and taught their arts. Indeed, the preëminence of
Greek culture became so great that Rome almost lost her ambition to be
original, and her writers vied with each other in their efforts to
reproduce in Latin what was choicest in Greek literature. As a
consequence of all this, the civilization and national life of Rome
became largely Grecian, and to Greece she owed her literature and her&nbsp;art.</p>

<p><b>Rome and the Modern World.</b>
After conquering the world, Rome impressed her language, laws, customs
of living, and modes of thinking upon the subject nations, and they
became Roman; and the world has remained largely Roman ever since. Latin
continued to live, and the knowledge of Latin was the only light of
learning that burned steadily through the dark ages that followed the
downfall of the Roman Empire. Latin was the common language of scholars
and remained so even down to the days of Shakespeare. Even yet it is

more nearly than any other tongue the universal language of the learned.
The life of to-day is much nearer the life of ancient Rome than the
lapse of centuries would lead one to suppose. You and I are Romans still
in many ways, and if Cæsar and Cicero should appear among us, we should
not find them, except for dress and language, much unlike men of
to-day.</p>

<p><b>Latin and English.</b>
Do you know that more than half of the words in the English dictionary
are Latin, and that you are speaking more or less Latin every day? How
has this come about? In the year 1066 William the Conqueror invaded
England with an army of Normans. The Normans spoke French&mdash;which,
you remember, is descended from Latin&mdash;and spread their language to
a considerable extent over England, and so Norman-French played an
important part in the formation of English and forms a large proportion
of our vocabulary. Furthermore, great numbers of almost pure Latin words
have been brought into English through the writings of scholars, and
every new scientific discovery is marked by the addition of new terms of
Latin derivation. Hence, while the simpler and commoner words of our
mother tongue are Anglo-Saxon, and Anglo-Saxon forms the staple of our
colloquial language, yet in the realms of literature, and especially in
poetry, words of Latin derivation are very abundant. Also in the learned
professions, as in law, medicine, and engineering, a knowledge of Latin
is necessary for the successful interpretation of technical and
scientific terms.</p>

<p><b>Why study Latin?</b>
The foregoing paragraphs make it clear why Latin forms so important a
part of modern education. We have seen that our civilization rests upon
that of Greece and Rome, and that we must look to the past if we would
understand the present. It is obvious, too, that the knowledge of Latin
not only leads to a more exact and effective use of our own language,
but that it is of vital importance and of great practical value to any
one preparing for a literary or professional career. To this it may be
added that the study of Latin throws a flood of light upon the structure
of language in general and lays an excellent foundation for all
grammatical study.

Finally, it has been abundantly proved that there is no more effective
means of strengthening the mind than by the earnest pursuit of this
branch of learning.</p>

<p><b>Review Questions</b>.
Whence does Latin get its name? Where is Latium? Where is Rome? Was
Latin always the same? What sort of Latin are we to study? Describe the
growth of Rome’s power and the spread of Latin. What can you say of the
origin of Italian, French, and Spanish? How did the ancient Greeks and
Romans compare? How did Greece influence Rome? How did Rome influence
the world? In what sense are we Romans still? What did Latin have to do
with the formation of English? What proportion of English words are of
Latin origin, and what kind of words are they? Why should we study
Latin?</p>

<h4>THE PRONUNCIATION OF LATIN</h4>

<h5>THE ALPHABET</h5>

<p class = "section">

The Latin alphabet contains the same letters as the English except that
it has no <i>w</i> and no <i>j</i>.</p>

<p class = "section">

The vowels, as in English, are <i>a, e, i, o, u, y</i>. The other
letters are consonants.</p>

<p class = "section">

<i>I</i> is used both as a vowel and as a consonant. Before a vowel in
the same syllable it has the value of a consonant and is called <i>I
consonant</i>.</p>

<p>Thus in Iū-li-us the first <i>i</i> is a consonant, the second a
vowel.</p>


<h5>SOUNDS OF THE LETTERS<span class = "tag">1</span></h5>

<div class = "footnote">
1. N.B. The sounds of the letters are best learned by hearing them
correctly pronounced. The matter in this section is, therefore, intended
for reference rather than for assignment as a lesson. As a first step it
is suggested that the teacher pronounce the examples in class, the
pupils following.</div>

<i>a.</i> In combinations of consonants give each its distinct sound.
Doubled consonants should be pronounced with a slight pause between the
two sounds. Thus pronounce <i>tt</i> as in <i>rat-trap</i>, not as in
<i>rattle</i>; <i>pp</i> as in <i>hop-pole</i>, not as in <i>upper</i>.

<h5>SYLLABLES</h5>

<p class = "section">

A Latin word has as many syllables as it has vowels and diphthongs. Thus
<b>aes-tā´-tĕ</b> has three syllables, <b>au-dĭ-ĕn´-dŭs</b> has
four.</p>

<p class = "note">
<i>a.</i> Two vowels with a consonant between them never make one
syllable, as is so often the case in English. Compare English
<i>inside</i> with Latin īn-sī´-dĕ.</p>

<p class = "section">

Words are divided into syllables as follows:</p>

<p>1. A single consonant between two vowels goes with the second. Thus
<b>ă-mā´-bĭ-lĭs</b>, <b>mĕ-mŏ´-rĭ-ă</b>, <b>ĭn-tĕ´-rĕ-ā</b>,
<b>ă´-bĕst</b>, <b>pĕ-rē´-gĭt</b>.<span class = "tag">3</span></p>

<div class = "footnote">
3. In writing and printing it is customary to divide the parts of a
compound, as <b>inter-eā</b>, <b>ab-est</b>, <b>sub-āctus</b>,
<b>per-ēgit</b>, contrary to the correct phonetic rule.</div>

<p>2. Combinations of two or more consonants:</p>

<p class = "note">
<i>a.</i> A consonant followed by <i>l</i> or <i>r</i> goes with the
<i>l</i> or <i>r</i>. Thus <b>pū´-blĭ-cŭs</b>, <b>ă´-grī</b>.</p>

<p class = "note">
<span class = "smallcaps">Exception.</span> Prepositional compounds of
this nature, as also <i>ll</i> and <i>rr</i>, follow rule <i>b</i>. Thus
<b>ăb´-lŭ-ō</b>, <b>ăb-rŭm´-pō</b>, <b>ĭl´-lĕ</b>, <b>fĕr´-rŭm</b>.</p>

<p class = "note">
<i>b.</i> In all other combinations of consonants the first consonant
goes with the preceding vowel.<span class = "tag">4</span> Thus
<b>măg´-nŭs</b>, <b>ĕ-gĕs´-tās</b>, <b>vĭc-tō´-rĭ-ă</b>,
<b>hŏs´-pĕs</b>, <b>ăn´-nŭs</b>, <b>sŭ-bāc´-tŭs</b>.</p>

<div class = "footnote">
4. The combination <b>nct</b> is divided <b>nc-t</b>, as <b>fūnc-tŭs,
sānc-tŭs</b>.</div>

<p>3. The last syllable of a word is called the <i>ul´-ti-ma</i>; the
one next to the last, the <i>pe-nult´</i>; the one before the penult,
the <i>an´-te-pe-nult´</i>.</p>
