<b>The Dative Case.</b> In addition to the relationships between words
expressed by the nominative, genitive (possessive), and accusative
(objective) cases, there are other relationships, to express which in
English we use such words as <i>from</i>, <i>with</i>, <i>by</i>,
<i>to</i>, <i>for</i>, <i>in</i>, <i>at</i>.<span class =
"tag">1</span></p>

<div class = "footnote">
1. Words like <i>to</i>, <i>for</i>, <i>by</i>, <i>from</i>, <i>in</i>,
etc., which define the relationship between words, are called
<b>prepositions</b>.</div>

<p>Latin, too, makes frequent use of such prepositions; but often it
expresses these relations without them by means of case forms which

English does not possess. One of the cases found in the Latin declension
and lacking in English is called the <i>dative</i>.</p>

<p class = "section">

When the nominative singular ends in <b>-a</b>, the dative singular ends
in <b>-ae</b> and the dative plural in <b>-īs</b>.</p>

<p class = "note">
<span class = "smallcaps">Note.</span> Observe that the <i>genitive
singular</i>, the <i>dative singular</i>, and the <i>nominative
plural</i> all have the same ending, <b>-ae</b>; but the uses of the
three cases are entirely different. The general meaning of the sentence
usually makes clear which case is intended.</p>


<p class = "section">

<b>The Dative Relation.</b> The dative case is used to express the
relations conveyed in English by the prepositions <i>to</i>,
<i>towards</i>, <i>for</i>.</p>

<p>These prepositions are often used in English in expressions of
motion, such as <i>She went to town</i>, <i>He ran towards the
horse</i>, <i>Columbus sailed for America</i>. In such cases the dative
is not used in Latin, as <i>motion through space</i> is foreign to the
dative relation. But the dative is used to denote that <i>to</i> or
<i>towards which</i> a benefit, injury, purpose, feeling, or quality is
directed, or that <i>for which</i> something serves or exists.</p>

<b>The Indirect Object.</b> Examine the sentence</p>

<p class = "center">
<b>Nauta fugam nūntiat</b>,
<i>the sailor announces the flight</i></p>

<p>Here the verb, <b>nūntiat</b>, governs the direct object,
<b>fugam</b>, in the accusative case. If, however, we wish to mention
the persons <b>to whom</b> the sailor announces the flight, as, <i>The
sailor announces the flight <b>to the farmers</b></i>, the verb will
have two objects:</p>

<table class = "fixed">
<tr>
<td>
<p class = "hanging">
1. Its direct object, <i>flight</i> (<b>fugam</b>)</p>
<p class = "hanging">
2. Its indirect object, <i>farmers</i></p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>





<span class = "smallcaps">Rule.</span> <b>Dative Indirect Object.</b>
<i>The indirect object of a verb is in the Dative.</i></p>

<p class = "note">
<i>a.</i> The indirect object usually stands before the direct
object.</p>

<p class = "section">

We may now complete the translation of the sentence <i>The sailor
announces the flight to the farmers</i>, and we have</p>

<p class = "center">
<b>Nauta agricolīs fugam nūntiat</b></p>
