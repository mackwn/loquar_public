<h6 class = "boldf">THE PASSIVE PERFECTS OF THE INDICATIVE · THE PERFECT
PASSIVE AND FUTURE ACTIVE INFINITIVE</h6>

<p class = "section">

The fourth and last of the principal parts (§&nbsp;183) is the <b>perfect passive participle</b>.
<i>From it we get the participial stem on which are formed the future
active infinitive and all the passive perfects.</i></p>

<p>1. Learn the following principal parts, which are for the first time
given in full:</p>

<p>2. The base of the participial stem is found by dropping <b>-us</b>
from the perfect passive participle.</p>

<p class = "section">

In English the perfect, past perfect, and future perfect tenses of the
indicative passive are made up of forms of the auxiliary verb <i>to
be</i> and the past participle; as, <i>I have been loved</i>, <i>I had
been loved</i>, <i>I shall have been loved.</i></p>

<p>Very similarly, in Latin, the perfect, pluperfect, and future perfect
passive tenses use respectively the present, imperfect, and future of
<b>sum</b> as an auxiliary verb with the perfect passive participle,
as</p>

<table>
<tr>
<td>
<p class = "hanging">
Perfect passive, <b>amā´tus sum</b>, <i>I have been</i> or <i>was
loved</i></p>
<p class = "hanging">
Pluperfect passive, <b>amā´tus eram</b>, <i>I had been loved</i></p>
<p class = "hanging">
Future perfect passive, <b>amā´tus erō</b>, <i>I shall have been
loved</i></p>
</td>
</tr>

<p>1. In the same way give the synopsis of the corresponding tenses of
<b>moneō</b>, <b>regō</b>, <b>capiō</b>, and <b>audiō</b>, and give the
English meanings.</p>

<p class = "section">

<b>Nature of the Participle.</b> A participle is partly verb and partly
adjective. As a verb it possesses tense and voice. As an adjective it

is declined and agrees with the word it modifies in gender, number, and
case.</p>

<p class = "section">

The perfect passive participle is declined like <b>bonus, bona,
bonum</b>, and in the compound tenses (§&nbsp;202) it agrees as a predicate adjective with the
subject of the verb.</p>

<table class = "lines">
<tr>
<td class = "sidehead">

praised</i>

<p>1. Inflect the perfect, pluperfect, and future perfect indicative
passive of <b>amō</b>, <b>moneō</b>, <b>regō</b>, <b>capiō</b>, and
<b>audiō</b> (§§&nbsp;488-492).</p>

<p class = "section">

<b>The perfect passive infinitive</b> is formed by adding <b>esse</b>,
the present infinitive of <b>sum</b>, to the perfect passive participle;
as, amā´t<b>-us</b> (<b>-a</b>, <b>-um</b>) <b>esse</b>, <i>to have been
loved</i>; mo´nit<b>-us</b> (<b>-a</b>, <b>-um</b>) <b>esse</b>, <i>to
have been advised</i>.</p>

<p>1. Form the perfect passive infinitive of <b>regō</b>, <b>capiō</b>,
<b>audiō</b>, and give the English meanings.</p>

<p class = "section">

The future active infinitive is formed by adding <b>esse</b>, the
present infinitive of <b>sum</b>, to the future active participle. This
participle is made by adding <b>-ūrus, -a, -um</b> to the base of the
participial stem. Thus the future active infinitive of <b>amō</b> is
amat<b>-ū´rus</b> (<b>-a</b>, <b>-um</b>) <b>esse</b>, <i>to be about to
love</i>.</p>

<p class = "note">
<i>a.</i> Note that in forming the three tenses of the active infinitive
we use all three conjugation stems:</p>

<table class = "fixed">
<tr>
<td>
<p class = "hanging">
Present, amā<b>re</b> (present stem), <i>to love</i></p>
<p class = "hanging">
Perfect, amāv<b>isse</b> (perfect stem), <i>to have loved</i></p>
<p class = "hanging">
Future, amāt<b>ūrus esse</b> (participial stem), <i>to be about to
love</i></p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>1. Give the three tenses of the active infinitive of <b>laudō</b>,
<b>moneō</b>, <b>regō</b>, <b>capiō</b>, <b>audiō</b>, with the English
meanings.</p>
