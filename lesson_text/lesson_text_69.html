When we report a statement instead of giving it directly, we have an
indirect statement. (Cf. .) So, if we
report a question instead of asking it directly, we have an indirect
question.</p>

<i>a.</i> An indirect question depends, usually as object, upon a verb
of asking (as <b>petō</b>, <b>postulō</b>, <b>quaerō</b>, <b>rogō</b>)
or upon some verb or expression of saying or mental action. (Cf. §&nbsp;420.)</p>

<i>a.</i> The verb in a direct question is in the indicative mood, but
the mood is subjunctive in an indirect question.</p>

sequence.</p>

words as introduce direct questions, excepting
that<i>yes</i>-or-<i>no</i> direct questions (cf. §&nbsp;210) on becoming indirect are usually introduced by
