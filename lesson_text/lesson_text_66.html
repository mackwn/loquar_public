<b>The Gerund.</b> Suppose we had to translate the sentence</p>

<p class = "center">
<i>By overcoming the Gauls Cæsar won great glory</i>
</p>

<p>We can see that <i>overcoming</i> here is a verbal noun corresponding
to the English infinitive in <i>-ing</i>, and that the thought calls for
the ablative of means. To translate this by the Latin infinitive would
be impossible, because the infinitive is indeclinable and therefore has
no ablative case form. Latin, however, has another verbal noun of
corresponding meaning, called the <b>gerund</b>, declined as a neuter of
the second declension in the <i>genitive</i>, <i>dative</i>,
<i>accusative</i>, and <i>ablative singular</i>, and thus supplying the
cases that the infinitive lacks.<span class = "tag">1</span> Hence, to

decline in Latin the verbal noun <i>overcoming</i>, we should use the
infinitive for the nominative and the gerund for the other cases, as
follows:</p>

<table class = "lines">
<tr>
<td class = "middle"><i>Nom.</i></td>
<td class = "middle rightline"><b>superāre</b></td>
<td><i>overcoming</i><br>
<i>to overcome</i></td>
<td class = "middle left smallcaps">Infinitive</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p class = "hanging">
<i>Gen.</i></p>
<p class = "hanging">
<i>Dat.</i></p>
<p class = "hanging">
<i>Acc.</i></p>
<p class = "hanging">
<i>Abl.</i>
</p></td>
<td colspan = "2"><p class = "hanging">
<b>superandī</b>, <i>of overcoming</i></p>
<p class = "hanging">
<b>superandō</b>, <i>for overcoming</i></p>
<p class = "hanging">
<b>superandum</b>, <i>overcoming</i></p>
<p class = "hanging">
<b>superandō</b>, <i>by overcoming</i></td>
<td class = "middle left smallcaps">Gerund</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Like the infinitive, the gerund governs the same case as the verb
from which it is derived. So the sentence given above becomes in
Latin</p>

<p class = "center">
<b>Superandō Gallōs Caesar magnam glōriam reportāvit</b>
</p>

<div class = "footnote">
1. Sometimes, however, the infinitive is used as an accusative.</div>

<p class = "section">

The gerund<span class = "tag">2</span> is formed by adding <b>-ndī,
-ndō, -ndum, -ndō</b>, to the present stem, which is shortened or
otherwise changed, as shown below:</p>

2. The gerund is the neuter singular of the future passive participle
used as a noun, and has the same formation. (Cf. §&nbsp;374.&nbsp;<i>d</i>.)</div>

<p class = "section">

<b>The Gerundive.</b> The gerundive is the name given to the future
passive participle ()
when the participle approaches the meaning of a verbal noun and is
translated like a gerund. It is the adjective corresponding to the
gerund. For example, to translate <i>the plan of waging war</i>, we may
use the gerund with its direct object and say <b>cōnsilium gerendī
bellum</b>; or we may use the gerundive and say <b>cōnsilium bellī
gerendī</b>, which means, literally, <i>the plan of the war to be
waged</i>, but which came to have the same force as the gerund with its
object, and was even preferred to it.</p>

We have learned that the word denoting the owner or possessor of
something is in the genitive, as, <b>equus Galbae</b>, <i>Galba’s
horse.</i> If, now, we wish to express the idea <i>the horse is
Galba’s</i>, Galba remains the possessor, and hence in the genitive as
before, but now stands in the predicate, as, <b>equus est Galbae</b>.
Hence this is called the predicate genitive.</p>
