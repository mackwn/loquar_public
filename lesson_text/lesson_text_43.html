<p class = "section">

We have become thoroughly familiar with expressions like the
following:</p>

<table>
<tr>
<td>
<p class = "hanging">
<b>Galba ad</b> (or <b>in</b>) <b>oppidum properat</b></p>
<p class = "hanging">
<b>Galba ab</b> (<b>dē</b> or <b>ex</b>) <b>oppidō properat</b></p>
<p class = "hanging">
<b>Galba in oppidō habitat</b></p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>From these expressions we may deduce the following rules:</p>

<p class = "section">

<span class = "smallcaps">Rule.</span> <b>Accusative of the Place

1. Small islands are classed with towns because they generally have but
one town, and the name of the town is the same as the name of the
island.</div>

<b>The Locative Case.</b> We saw above that the place-relation expressed
by <i>at</i> or <i>in</i> is regularly covered by the locative ablative.
However, Latin originally expressed this relation by a separate form
known as the <i>locative case</i>. This case has been everywhere merged
in the ablative excepting in the singular number of the first and second
declensions. The form of the locative in these declensions is like the
genitive singular, and its use is limited to names of towns and small
islands, <b>domī</b>, <i>at home</i>, and a few other words.</p>

<p><b>Athēnīs</b> and <b>Pompēiīs</b> are locative ablatives. These
words can have no locative case, as the nominatives <b>Athēnae</b> and
<b>Pompēiī</b> are<i>plural</i> and there is no plural locative case
form.</p>
