Learn the subjunctive of <b>possum</b> (§&nbsp;495), and note especially the
position of the accent.</p>

<b>Subjunctive after Verbs of Fearing.</b> We have learned that what we
want done or not done is expressed in Latin by a subjunctive clause of
purpose. In this class belong also <i>clauses after verbs of
fearing</i>, for we fear either that something will happen or that it
will not, and we either want it to happen or we do not. If we want a
thing to happen and fear that it will not, the purpose clause is
introduced by <b>ut</b>. If we do not want it to happen and fear that it
will, <b>nē</b> is used. Owing to a difference between the English and
Latin idiom we translate <b>ut</b> after a verb of fearing by <i>that
not</i>, and <b>nē</b> by <i>that</i> or <i>lest</i>.</p>
