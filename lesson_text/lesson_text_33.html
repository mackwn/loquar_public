<b>The Infinitive with Subject Accusative.</b> The <i>infinitive</i>
(cf. ) is a <i>verbal noun</i>. Used
as a noun, it has the constructions of a noun. As a verb it can govern a
case and be modified by an adverb. The uses of the infinitive are much
the same in Latin as in English.</p>


1. In English certain verbs of <i>wishing, commanding, forbidding</i>,
and the like are used with an object clause consisting of a substantive
in the objective case and an infinitive, as, <i>he commanded the men to
flee</i>. Such object clauses are called infinitive clauses, and the
substantive is said to be the subject of the infinitive.</p>

<p>Similarly in Latin, some verbs of <i>wishing, commanding,
forbidding</i>, and the like are used with an object clause consisting
of an infinitive with a subject in the accusative case, as, <b>Is virōs
fugere iussit</b>, <i>he commanded the men to flee</i>.</p>

<span class = "smallcaps">Rule.</span> <b>Subject of the Infinitive.</b>
<i>The subject of the infinitive is in the accusative.</i></p>

<b>The Complementary Infinitive.</b> In English a verb is often followed
by an infinitive to complete its meaning, as, <i>the Romans are able to
conquer the Gauls</i>. This is called the <i>complementary</i>
infinitive, as the predicate is not <i>complete</i> without the added
infinitive.</p>

<p>Similarly in Latin, <i>verbs of incomplete predication</i> are
completed by the infinitive. Among such verbs are <b>possum</b>, <i>I am
able, I can</i>; <b>properō</b>, <b>mātūrō</b>, <i>I hasten</i>;
<b>temptō</b>, <i>I attempt</i>; as</p>

<table>
<tr>
<td>
<p class = "hanging">
<b>Rōmānī Gallōs superāre possunt</b>, <i>the Romans are able to</i> (or
<i>can</i>) <i>conquer the Gauls</i></p>
<p class = "hanging">
<b>Bellum gerere mātūrant</b>, <i>they hasten to wage war</i></p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p class = "note">
<i>a.</i> A predicate adjective completing a complementary infinitive
agrees in gender, number, and case with the subject of the main
verb.</p>

<p class = "center">
<b>Malī puerī esse bonī nōn possunt</b>, <i>bad boys are not able to</i>
(or <i>cannot</i>) <i>be good.</i></p>

<p>Observe that <b>bonī</b> agrees with <b>puerī</b>.</p>

<p class = "section">

<b>The Infinitive used as a Noun.</b> In English the infinitive is often
used as a pure noun, as the subject of a sentence, or as a predicate
nominative. For example, <i>To conquer</i> (= conquering) <i>is
pleasing; To see</i> (= seeing) <i>is to believe</i> (= believing). The
same use of the infinitive is found in Latin, especially with
<b>est</b>, as</p>

<table>
<tr>
<td>
<p class = "hanging">
<b>Superāre est grātum</b>, <i>to conquer is pleasing</i></p>
<p class = "hanging">
<b>Vidēre est crēdere</b>, <i>to see is to believe</i></p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p class = "note">

<i>a.</i> In the construction above, the infinitive often has a subject,
which must then be in the accusative case, as</p>

<p class = "center">
<b>Galbam superāre inimīcōs est grātum multīs</b>,<br>
<i>for Galba to conquer his enemies is pleasing to many</i></p>

<p class = "note">
<i>b.</i> An infinitive used as a noun is neuter singular. Thus, in the
sentence <b>superāre est grātum</b>, the predicate adjective
<b>grātum</b> is in the neuter nominative singular to agree with
<b>superāre</b> the subject.</p>
