<h6 class = "boldf">THE IRREGULAR VERB <i>FĪŌ</i> · THE SUBJUNCTIVE OF
RESULT</h6>

<p class = "section">

The verb <b>fīō</b>, <i>be made, happen</i>, serves as the passive of
<b>faciō</b>, <i>make</i>, in the present system. The rest of the verb
is formed regularly from <b>faciō</b>. Learn the principal parts and
conjugation ().
Observe that the <b>i</b> is long except before <b>-er</b> and in
<b>fit</b>.</p>

<p class = "note">
<i>a.</i> The compounds of <b>facio</b> with prepositions usually form
the passive regularly, as,</p>

Observe the following sentences:</p>

<p>1. <b>Terror erat tantus ut omnēs fugerent</b>, <i>the terror was so
great that all fled.</i></p>

<p>2. <b>Terror erat tantus ut nōn facile mīlitēs sēsē reciperent</b>,
<i>the terror was so great that the soldiers did not easily recover
themselves.</i></p>

<p>3. <b>Terror fēcit ut omnēs fugerent</b>, <i>terror caused all to
flee</i> (lit. <i>made that all fled</i>).</p>

<p class = "note">
<i>a.</i> Each of these sentences is complex, containing a principal
clause and a subordinate clause.</p>

<p class = "note">
<i>b.</i> The principal clause names a cause and the subordinate clause
states the <i>consequence</i> or <i>result</i> of this cause.</p>

<p class = "note">
<i>c.</i> The subordinate clause has its verb in the subjunctive, though
it is translated like an indicative. The construction is called the
<i>subjunctive of consequence or result</i>, and the clause is called a
consecutive or result clause.</p>

<p class = "note">
<i>d.</i> In the last example the clause of result is the object of the
verb <b>fēcit</b>.</p>

<p class = "note">
<i>e.</i> The conjunction introducing the consecutive or result clause
is <b>ut</b> = <i>so that</i>; negative, <b>ut nōn</b> = <i>so that
not</i>.</p>

<p class = "section">

<span class = "smallcaps">Rule.</span> <b>Subjunctive of Result.</b>
<i>Consecutive clauses of result are introduced by <b>ut</b> or <b>ut
nōn</b> and have the verb in the subjunctive.</i></p>

<p class = "section">

<span class = "smallcaps">Rule.</span> <i>Object clauses of result with
<b>ut</b> or <b>ut nōn</b> are found after verbs of <b>effecting</b> or
<b>bringing about</b>.</i></p>

<b>Purpose and Result Clauses Compared.</b> There is great similarity in
the expression of purpose and of result in Latin. If

the sentence is affirmative, both purpose and result clauses may be
introduced by <b>ut</b>; but if the sentence is negative, the purpose
clause has <b>nē</b> and the result clause <b>ut nōn</b>. Result clauses
are often preceded in the main clause by such words as <b>tam</b>,
<b>ita</b>, <b>sic</b> (<i>so</i>), and these serve to point them out.
