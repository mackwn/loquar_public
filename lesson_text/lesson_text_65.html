<h6 class = "boldf">THE CONSTRUCTIONS WITH THE CONJUNCTION <i>CUM</i> ·
THE ABLATIVE OF SPECIFICATION</h6>

<p class = "section">

The conjunction <b>cum</b> has the following meanings and
constructions:</p>

<table class = "fixed">
<tr><td>
<p class = "hanging">
<b>cum</b> <span class = "smallcaps">temporal</span> = <i>when</i>,
followed by the indicative or the subjunctive</p>
<p class = "hanging">
<b>cum</b> <span class = "smallcaps">causal</span> = <i>since</i>,
followed by the subjunctive</p>
<p class = "hanging">
<b>cum</b> <span class = "smallcaps">concessive</span> =
<i>although</i>, followed by the subjunctive</p>
</td></tr>

<p>As you observe, the mood after <b>cum</b> is sometimes indicative and
sometimes subjunctive. The reason for this will be made clear by a study
of the following sentences:</p>

<p>1. <b>Caesarem vīdī tum cum in Galliā eram</b>, <i>I saw Cæsar at the
time when I was in Gaul</i>.</p>

<p>2. <b>Caesar in eōs impetum fēcit cum pācem peterent</b>, <i>Cæsar
made an attack upon them when they were seeking peace</i>.</p>

<p>3. <b>Hoc erat difficile cum paucī sine vulneribus essent</b>,
<i>this was difficult, since only a few were without wounds</i>.</p>

<p>4. <b>Cum prīmī ōrdinēs fūgissent, tamen reliquī fortiter
cōnsistēbant</b>, <i>though the front ranks had fled, yet the rest
bravely stood their ground</i>.</p>

<p class = "note">
<i>a.</i> The underlying principle is one already familiar to you (cf.
). When the <b>cum</b> clause states
a fact and simply <i>fixes the time</i> at which the main action took
place, the indicative mood is used. So, in the first example, <b>cum in
Galliā eram</b> fixes the time when I saw Cæsar.</p>

<p class = "note">

<i>b.</i> On the other hand, when the <b>cum</b> clause <i>describes the
circumstances</i> under which the main act took place, the subjunctive
mood is used. So, in the second example, the principal clause states
that Cæsar made an attack, and the <b>cum</b> clause describes the
circumstances under which this act occurred. The idea of <i>time</i> is
also present, but it is subordinate to the idea of <i>description</i>.
Sometimes the descriptive clause is one of <i>cause</i> and we translate
<b>cum</b> by <i>since</i>; sometimes it denotes <i>concession</i> and
<b>cum</b> is translated <i>although</i>.</p>

<p class = "section">

<span class = "smallcaps">Rule.</span> <b>Constructions with
<i>Cum</i></b>. <i>The conjunction <b>cum</b> means <b>when</b>,
<b>since</b>, or <b>although</b>. It is followed by the subjunctive
unless it means <b>when</b> and its clause fixes the time at which the
main action took place.</i></p>

<p class = "note">
<span class = "smallcaps">Note.</span> <b>Cum</b> in clauses of
description with the subjunctive is much more common than its use with
the indicative.</p>

Note the following sentences:</p>

<p>1. <b>Oppidum erat parvum magnitūdine sed magnum multitūdine
hominum</b>, <i>the town was small in size but great in
population</i>.</p>

<p>2. <b>Homō erat corpore īnfīrmus sed validus animō</b>, <i>the man
was weak in body but strong in courage</i>.</p>

<p class = "note">
<i>a.</i> Observe that <b>magnitūdine</b>, <b>multitūdine</b>,
<b>corpore</b>, and <b>animō</b> tell <i>in what respect</i> something
is true. The relation is one covered by the ablative case, and the
construction is called the <i>ablative of specification</i>.</p>

<span class = "smallcaps">Rule.</span> <b>Ablative of Specification.</b>
<i>The ablative is used to denote <b>in what respect</b> something is
true.</i></p>
