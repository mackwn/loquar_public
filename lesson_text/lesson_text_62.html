LESSON LXVII</h5>

<h6 class = "boldf">THE IRREGULAR VERBS <i>VOLŌ</i>, <i>NŌLŌ</i>,
<i>MĀLŌ</i> · THE ABLATIVE WITH A PARTICIPLE, OR ABLATIVE ABSOLUTE</h6>

<p class = "section">

Learn the principal parts and conjugation of <b>volō</b>, <i>wish</i>;
<b>nōlō</b> (<b>ne</b> + <b>volō</b>), <i>be unwilling</i>; <b>mālō</b>
(<b>magis</b> + <b>volō</b>), <i>be more willing, prefer</i> (§&nbsp;497). Note the irregularities in
the present indicative, subjunctive, and infinitive, and in the
imperfect subjunctive. (Cf. .)</p>

<p class = "note">
<i>a.</i> These verbs are usually followed by the infinitive with or
without a subject accusative; as, <b>volunt venīre</b>, <i>they wish to
come</i>; <b>volunt amīcōs venīre</b>, <i>they wish their friends to
come</i>. The English usage is the same.<span class = "tag">1</span></p>

<div class = "footnote">
1. Sometimes the subjunctive of purpose is used after these verbs. (See
.)</div>

Observe the following sentences:</p>

<p>1. <b>Magistrō laudante omnēs puerī dīligenter labōrant</b>, <i>with
the teacher praising</i>, or <i>since the teacher praises</i>, or <i>the
teacher praising, all the boys labor diligently.</i></p>

<p>

2. <b>Caesare dūcente nēmō prōgredī timet</b>, <i>with Cæsar
leading</i>, or <i>when Cæsar leads</i>, or <i>if Cæsar leads</i>, or
<i>Cæsar leading, no one fears to advance.</i></p>

<p>3. <b>His rēbus cognitīs mīlitēs fūgērunt</b>, <i>when this was
known</i>, or <i>since this was known</i>, or <i>these things having
been learned, the soldiers fled.</i></p>

<p>4. <b>Proeliō commissō multī vulnerātī sunt</b>, <i>after the battle
had begun</i>, or <i>when the battle had begun</i>, or <i>the battle
having been joined, many were wounded.</i></p>

<p class = "note">
<i>a.</i> One of the fundamental ablative relations is expressed in
English by the preposition <i>with</i> (cf. §&nbsp;50). In each of the sentences above we have a noun
and a participle in agreement in the ablative, and the translation shows
that in each instance the ablative expresses <i>attendant
circumstance</i>. For example, in the first sentence the circumstance
attending or accompanying the diligent labor of the boys is the praise
of the teacher. This is clearly a <i>with</i> relation, and the ablative
is the case to use.</p>

<p class = "note">
<i>b.</i> We observe, further, that the ablative and its participle are
absolutely independent grammatically of the rest of the sentence. If we
were to express the thought in English in a similar way, we should use
the nominative independent or absolute. In Latin the construction is
called the Ablative Absolute, or the Ablative with a Participle. This
form of expression is exceedingly common in Latin, but rather rare in
English, so we must not, as a rule, employ the English absolute
construction to translate the ablative abolute. The attendant
circumstance may be one of <i>time</i> (when or after), or one of
<i>cause</i> (since), or one of <i>concession</i> (though), or one of
<i>condition</i> (if). In each case try to discover the precise
relation, and tranlate the ablative and its participle by a clause which
will best express the thought.</p>

<span class = "smallcaps">Rule.</span> <b>Ablative Absolute.</b> <i>The
ablative of a noun or pronoun with a present or perfect participle in
agreement is used to express attendant circumstance.</i></p>

<p class = "note">
<span class = "smallcaps">Note 1.</span> The verb <b>sum</b> has no
present participle. In consequence we often find two nouns or a noun and
an adjective in the ablative absolute with no participle expressed; as,
<b>tē duce</b>, <i>you</i> (being) <i>leader</i>, <i>with you as
leader</i>; <b>patre īnfirmō</b>, <i>my father</i> (being)
<i>weak</i>.</p>

<p class = "note">
<span class = "smallcaps">Note 2.</span> Be very careful not to put in
the ablative absolute a noun and participle that form the subject or
object of a sentence. Compare</p>

In <i>a</i> the subject is <i>The Gauls having been conquered by
Cæsar</i>, and we translate,</p>

</p>

<p class = "note">

In <i>b</i> the subject is <i>the army</i>. <i>The Gauls having been
conquered by Cæsar</i> is nominative absolute in English, which requires
the ablative absolute in Latin, and we translate,

<p class = "center">
<b>Gallīs ā Caesare victīs exercitus domum revertit</b>
</p>

<p class = "note">
<span class = "smallcaps">Note 3.</span> The fact that only deponent
verbs have a perfect active participle (cf. §&nbsp;375.&nbsp;<i>a</i>) often compels a change of voice
when translating from one language to the other. For example, we can
translate <i>Cæsar having encouraged the legions</i> just as it stands,
because <b>hortor</b> is a deponent verb. But if we wish to say <i>Cæsar
having conquered the Gauls</i>, we have to change the voice of the
participle to the passive because <b>vincō</b> is not deponent, and say,
<i>the Gauls having been conquered by Cæsar</i> (see translation
above).</p>
