<h6 class = "boldf">VOCABULARY REVIEW · THE GENITIVE AND ABLATIVE OF
QUALITY OR DESCRIPTION</h6>

<p class = "section">

Review the word lists in §§&nbsp;524, 525.</p>

<p class = "section">

Observe the English sentences</p>

<table class = "fixed">
<tr><td>
<p class = "hanging">
(1) <i>A man <b>of</b> great courage</i>, or (2) <i>A man <b>with</b>
great courage</i>
</p>
<p class = "hanging">
(3) <i>A forest <b>of</b> tall trees</i>, or (4) <i>A forest <b>with</b>
tall trees</i></p>
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Each of these sentences contains a phrase of quality or description.
In the first two a man is described; in the last two a forest. The
descriptive phrases are introduced by the prepositions <i>of</i> and
<i>with</i>.</p>

<p>

In Latin the expression of quality or description is very similar.</p>

<p>The prepositions <i>of</i> and <i>with</i> suggest the genitive and
the ablative respectively, and we translate the sentences above</p>

<table class = "fixed">
<tr><td>
<p class = "hanging">
(1) <b>Vir magnae virtūtis</b>, or (2) <b>Vir magnā virtūte</b></p>
<p class = "hanging">
(3) <b>Silva altārum arborum</b>, or (4) <b>Silva altīs
arboribus</b></p>
</td></tr>

<p>There is, however, one important difference between the Latin and the
English. In English we may say, for example, <i>a man of courage</i>,
using the descriptive phrase without an adjective modifier. <i>In Latin,
however, an adjective modifier must always be used</i>, as above.</p>

<p class = "note">
<i>a.</i> Latin makes a distinction between the use of the two cases in
that <i>numerical descriptions of measure are in the genitive</i> and
<i>descriptions of physical characteristics are in the ablative.</i>
Other descriptive phrases may be in either case.</p>
