<h6 class = "boldf">THE SUBJUNCTIVE OF CHARACTERISTIC OR DESCRIPTION ·
THE PREDICATE ACCUSATIVE</h6>

<p class = "section">

Akin to the subjunctive of consequence or result is the use of the
subjunctive in clauses of characteristic or description.</p>

<p>This construction is illustrated in the following sentences:</p>

<p>1. <b>Quis est quī suam domum nōn amet?</b> <i>who is there who does
not love his own home?</i></p>

<p>2. <b>Erant quī hoc facere nōllent</b>, <i>there were (some) who were
unwilling to do this.</i></p>

<p>3. <b>Tū nōn is es quī amīcōs trādās</b>, <i>you are not such a one
as to</i>, or <i>you are not the man to, betray your friends.</i></p>

<p>4. <b>Nihil videō quod timeam</b>, <i>I see nothing to fear</i>
(nothing of such as character as to fear it).</p>

<p class = "note">
<i>a.</i> Each of these examples contains a descriptive relative clause
which tells what kind of a person or thing the antecedent is. To express
this thought the subjunctive is used. A relative clause that merely
states a fact and does not describe the antecedent uses the indicative.

<i>b.</i> Observe that in this construction a demonstrative pronoun and
a relative, as is <b>quī</b>, are translated <i>such a one as to, the
man to</i>.</p>

<table>
<tr><td>
<p class = "hanging">
1. Rōmānī <b>Caesarem cōnsulem</b> fēcērunt, <i>the Romans made <b>Cæsar
consul</b></i>.</p>

2. <b>Caesar cōnsul</b> ā Rōmānīs factus est, <i><b>Cæsar</b> was made
<b>consul</b> by the Romans</i>.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>

<p class = "note">
<i>a.</i> Observe in 1 that the transitive verb <b>fēcērunt</b>,
<i>made</i>, has two objects: (1) the direct object, <b>Caesarem</b>;
(2) a second object, <b>cōnsulem</b>, referring to the same person as
the direct object and completing the predicate. The second accusative is
called a Predicate Accusative.</p>

<p class = "note">
<i>b.</i> Observe in 2 that when the verb is changed to the passive both
of the accusatives become nominatives, the <i>direct object</i> becoming
the <i>subject</i> and the <i>predicate accusative</i> the <i>predicate
nominative</i>.</p>

<span class = "smallcaps">Rule.</span> <b>Two Accusatives.</b> <i>Verbs
of <b>making</b>, <b>choosing</b>, <b>calling</b>, <b>showing</b>, and
