LESSON XXVIII</h5>

<h6 class = "boldf">PRESENT, IMPERFECT, AND FUTURE INDICATIVE PASSIVE OF
<i>REGŌ</i> AND <i>AUDIŌ</i></h6>

<p class = "section">

Review the present, imperfect, and future indicative active of
<b>regō</b> and <b>audiō</b>, and learn the passive of the same tenses
(, 491).</p>

<p class = "note">
<i>a.</i> Observe that the tense signs of the imperfect and future are
the same as in the active voice, and that the passive personal endings
() are added instead of the active
ones.</p>

<p class = "note">
<i>b.</i> Note the slight irregularity in the second person singular
present of the third conjugation. There the final <b>-e-</b> of the stem
is not changed to <b>-i-</b>, as it is in the active. We therefore have
<b>re´geris</b> or <b>re´gere</b>, <i>not</i> <b>re´giris</b>,
<b>re´gire</b>.</p>

<p class = "note">
<i>c.</i> Inflect <b>agō</b>, <b>dīcō</b>, <b>dūcō</b>, <b>mūniō</b>,
<b>reperiō</b>, in the present, imperfect, and future indicative, active
and passive.</p>
