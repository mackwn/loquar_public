Ablative II
</h5>



<p class = "section">

Of the various relations denoted by the ablative case there is none more important than that expressed
in English by the preposition <i>with</i>. This little word is not so
simple as it looks. It does not always convey the same meaning, nor is
it always to be translated by <b>cum</b>. This will become clear from
the following sentences:</p>

<table class = "fixed">
<tr>
<td>
<p class = "hanging">
<i>a.</i> Mark is feeble <i>with</i> (<i>for</i> or <i>because of</i>)
want of food</p>
<p class = "hanging">
<i>b.</i> Diana kills the beasts <i>with</i> (or <i>by</i>) her
arrows</p>
<p class = "hanging">
<i>c.</i> Julia is <i>with</i> Sextus</p>
<p class = "hanging">
<i>d.</i> The men fight <i>with</i> great steadiness</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p class = "note">
<i>a.</i> In sentence <i>a</i>, <i>with want</i> (<i>of food</i>) gives
the cause of Mark’s feebleness. This idea is expressed in Latin by the
ablative without a preposition, and the construction is called the
<b>ablative of cause</b>:</p>

<p class = "center">
<b>Mārcus est īnfīrmus inopiā cibī</b></p>

<p class = "note">
<i>b.</i> In sentence <i>b</i>, <i>with</i> (or <i>by</i>) <i>her
arrows</i> tells <b>by means of what</b> Diana kills the beasts. This
idea is expressed in Latin by the ablative without a preposition, and
the construction is called the <b>ablative of means</b>:</p>

<p class = "center">
<b>Diāna sagittīs suīs ferās necat</b></p>

<p class = "note">
<i>c.</i> In sentence <i>c</i> we are told that Julia is not alone, but
<b>in company with</b> Sextus. This idea is expressed in Latin by the
ablative with the preposition <b>cum</b>, and the construction is called
the <b>ablative of accompaniment</b>:</p>

<p class = "center">
<b>Iūlia est cum Sextō</b></p>

<p class = "note">
<i>d.</i> In sentence <i>d</i> we are told how the men fight. The idea
is one of <b>manner</b>. This is expressed in Latin by the ablative with
<b>cum</b>, unless there is a modifying adjective present, in which case
<b>cum</b> may be omitted. This construction is called the <b>ablative
of manner</b>:</p>

<p class = "center">
<b>Virī (cum) cōnstantiā magnā pugnant</b></p>

<p class = "section">

You are now able to form four important rules for the ablative denoting
<i>with</i>:</p>

<p class = "section">


<span class = "smallcaps">Rule.</span> <b>Ablative of Cause.</b>
<i>Cause is denoted by the ablative without a preposition. This answers
the question Because of what?</i></p>

<p class = "section">

<span class = "smallcaps">Rule.</span> <b>Ablative of Means.</b>
<i>Means is denoted by the ablative without a preposition. This answers
the question By means of what? With what?</i></p>

<p class = "note">
N.B. <b>Cum</b> must never be used with the ablative expressing cause or
means.</p>

<p class = "section">

<span class = "smallcaps">Rule.</span> <b>Ablative of Accompaniment.</b>
<i>Accompaniment is denoted by the ablative with <b>cum</b>. This
answers the question With whom?</i></p>

<p class = "section">

<span class = "smallcaps">Rule.</span> <b>Ablative of Manner.</b> <i>The
ablative with <b>cum</b> is used to denote the manner of an action.
<b>Cum</b> may be omitted, if an adjective is used with the ablative.
This answers the question How? In what manner?</i></p>
