<b>Subject and Predicate.</b> 1. Latin, like English, expresses thoughts
by means of sentences. A sentence is a combination of words that
expresses a thought, and in its simplest form is the statement of a
single fact. Thus,</p>

<i>a.</i> The sentences above show that Latin does not express some
words which are necessary in English. First of all, <i>Latin has no
article <b>the</b> or <b>a</b></i>; thus <i><b>agricola</b></i> may mean
<i>the farmer, a farmer</i>, or simply <i>farmer</i>. Then, too, the
personal pronouns, <i>I, you, he, she</i>, etc., and the possessive
pronouns, <i>my, your, his, her</i>, etc., are not expressed if the
meaning of the sentence is clear without them.</p>



<p class = "section">

<b>Inflection.</b> Words may change their forms to indicate some change
in sense or use, as, <i>is, are; was, were; who, whose, whom; farmer,
farmer’s; woman, women</i>. This is called <b>inflection</b>. The
inflection of a noun, adjective, or pronoun is called its
<b>declension</b>, that of a verb its <b>conjugation</b>.</p>

<p class = "section">

<b>Number.</b> Latin, like English, has two numbers, singular and
plural. In English we usually form the plural by adding <i>-s</i> or
<i>-es</i> to the singular. So Latin changes the singular to the plural
by changing the ending of the word. Compare</p>
