<b>Declension of Nouns.</b> We learned above (§§&nbsp;19, ) the difference
between the subject and object, and that in English they may be
distinguished by the order of the words. Sometimes, however, the order
is such that we are left in doubt. For example, the sentence <i>The lady
her daughter loves</i> might mean either that the lady loves her
daughter, or that the daughter loves the lady.</p>

<p>1. If the sentence were in Latin, no doubt could arise, because the
subject and the object are distinguished, not by the order of the words,
but by the endings of the words themselves. Compare the following
sentences:</p>

<table class = "lines">
<tr>
<td>
<b>Domina fīliam amat</b><br>
<b>Fīliam domina amat</b><br>
<b>Amat fīliam domina</b><br>
<b>Domina amat fīliam</b>
</td>
<td class = "middle left ital">
The lady loves her daughter
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<b>Fīlia dominam amat</b><br>
<b>Dominam fīlia amat</b><br>
<b>Amat dominam fīlia</b><br>
<b>Fīlia amat dominam</b>
</td>
<td class = "middle left ital">
The daughter loves the lady
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p class = "note">
<i>a.</i> Observe that in each case the subject of the sentence ends in
<b>-a</b> and the object in <b>-am</b>. The <i>form</i> of the noun
shows how it is used in the sentence, and the order of the words has no
effect on the essential meaning.</p>

<p>2. As stated above (), this change of
ending is called <b>declension</b>, and each different ending produces
what is called a <b>case</b>. When we decline a noun, we give all its
different cases, or changes of endings. In English we have three
cases,&mdash;nominative, possessive, and objective; but, in nouns, the
nominative and objective have the same form, and only the possessive
case shows a change of ending, by adding <i>’s</i> or the apostrophe.
The interrogative pronoun, however, has the fuller declension,
<i>who?</i> <i>whose?</i> <i>whom?</i></p>

The following table shows a comparison between English and Latin
declension forms, and should be thoroughly memorized:</p>

We learned from the table that the
Latin nominative, genitive, and accusative correspond, in general, to
the nominative, possessive, and objective in English, and that they are
used in the same way. This will be made even clearer by the following
sentence:</p>

<p class = "center">
<b>Fīlia agricolae nautam amat</b>,<br>
<i>the farmer’s daughter</i> (or <i>the daughter of the farmer</i>)
<i>loves the sailor</i>
</p>

<span class = "smallcaps">Rule.</span> <b>Nominative Subject.</b> <i>The
subject of a finite verb is in the Nominative and answers the question
