1. The tense sign is <b>-bā-</b>, as in the first two conjugations.</p>

<p>2. Observe that the final <b>-ĕ-</b> of the stem is lengthened before
the tense sign <b>-bā-</b>. This makes the imperfect of the third
conjugation just like the imperfect of the second (cf. <b>monēbam</b>
and <b>regēbam</b>).</p>

<p>3. In the fourth conjugation <b>-ē-</b> is inserted between the stem
and the tense sign <b>-bā-</b> (<b>audi-ē-ba-m</b>).</p>

<p>4. In a similar manner inflect the verbs given in §&nbsp;148.</p>
