<b>Tense Signs.</b> Instead of using auxiliary verbs to express
differences in tense, like <i>was</i>, <i>shall</i>, <i>will</i>, etc.,
Latin adds to the verb stem certain elements that have the force of
auxiliary verbs. These are called <i>tense signs</i>.</p>

<p class = "section">

<b>Formation and Inflection of the Imperfect.</b> The tense sign of the
imperfect is <b>-bā-</b>, which is added to the present stem. The
imperfect consists, therefore, of three parts:</p>

<table>
<tr>
<th>Present Stem</th>
<th>Tense Sign</th>
<td class = "smallest">PERSONAL<br>
ENDING</td>

<tr>
<td><b>amā-</b></td>
<td><b>ba-</b></td>
<td><b>m</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><i>loving</i></td>
<td><i>was</i></td>
<td><i>I</i></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The inflection is as follows:</p>

<p class = "note">
<i>a.</i> Note that the <b>ā</b> of the tense sign <b>-bā-</b> is
shortened before <b>-nt</b>, and before <b>m</b> and <b>t</b> when
final. (Cf. .)</p>

<p>In a similar manner inflect the verbs given in §&nbsp;129.</p>

<p class = "section">

<b>Meaning of the Imperfect.</b> The Latin imperfect describes an act as
<i>going on</i> or <i>progressing in past time</i>, like the English
past-progressive tense (as, <i>I was walking</i>). It is the regular
tense used to describe a past situation or condition of affairs.</p>
