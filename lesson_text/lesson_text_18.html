LESSON XXII</h5>

<h6 class = "boldf">REVIEW OF VERBS · THE DATIVE WITH ADJECTIVES</h6>

<p class = "section">

Review the present, imperfect, and future active indicative, both orally
and in writing, of <b>sum</b> and the verbs in §&nbsp;129.</p>

<p class = "section">

We learned in  for what sort of
expressions we may expect the dative, and in §&nbsp;44 that one of its commonest uses is with
<i>verbs</i> to express the indirect object. It is also very common with
<i>adjectives</i> to express the object toward which the quality denoted
by the adjective is directed. We have already had a number of cases

where <b>grātus</b>, <i>agreeable to</i>, was so followed by a dative;
and in the last lesson we had <b>molestus</b>, <i>annoying to</i>,
followed by that case. The usage may be more explicitly stated by the
following rule:</p>

<span class = "smallcaps">Rule.</span> <b>Dative with Adjectives.</b>
<i>The dative is used with adjectives to denote the object toward which
the given quality is directed. Such are, especially, those meaning
<b>near</b>, also <b>fit</b>, <b>friendly</b>, <b>pleasing</b>,
<b>like</b>, and their opposites.</i></p>

Among such adjectives memorize the following:</p>
