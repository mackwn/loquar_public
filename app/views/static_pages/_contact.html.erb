        Loquar is a pet project of a single amateur developer whose other non-professional
        part time occupation happens to be aspiring Latinist and classics autodidact.

        to discuss Latin / Latin autodidacticism - drop me an email at <%= mail_to ENV["FEEDBACK_EMAIL"], ENV["FEEDBACK_EMAIL"] %>.
